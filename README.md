# CrackingTheCodingInterview

In this repository you can see some of my earlier solutions 
of problems from Gayle Laakmann's book "Cracking The Coding Interview" of the 5th edition.  
Most of the problems solved using Python 3 and Jupyter Notebook.

I used [this](https://www.ozon.ru/context/detail/id/8387468/) version of book.

One notebook per each chapter. Each notebook contain solutions (no conditions), my thoughts about them.
And my attempts to solve/improove them.

Not all of the problems are solved yet but most of them (except a few chapters). 
Also some of problems solved not correctly   
(but in these cases they are marked somehow or commented/discussed).

In future solutions from this repo can be fixed/prettified and merged with [official repo](https://github.com/careercup/CtCI-6th-Edition-Python).
